# Galaxy Generator NodeJS

# About

Small [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) & [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) script created in one evening. 
Aiming to return an array with the position of several stars with their colors, this is generated randomly.

The script fetches the array and renders the galaxy on the client side with [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/).
